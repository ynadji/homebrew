.SH "NAME"
\fBbrew\fR \- The missing package manager for OS X
.
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fBbrew\fR [\-\-verbose|\-v] command [options] [formula] \.\.\.
.
.br
\fBbrew\fR [\-\-version|\-v]
.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Homebrew is the easiest and most flexible way to install the UNIX tools Apple didn\'t include with OS X\.
.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.
.TP
\fB\-v\fR, \fB\-\-verbose\fR command [options] [formula] \.\.\.
Prints extra, comand\-specific debugging information\. Note that \fBbrew \-v\fR by itself is the same as \fBbrew \-\-version\fR\.
.
.SH "COMMANDS"
.
.TP
\fB\-v\fR, \fB\-\-version\fR
Prints the version number of brew to standard error and exits\.
.
.TP
\fB\-\-prefix\fR [\fIformula\fR]
Displays the install path for Homebrew\. If \fIformula\fR is given, display location in the cellar where that package is or would be installed\.
.
.TP
\fB\-\-cache\fR [\fIformula\fR]
Displays the path Homebrew uses to cache downloads\. If \fIformula\fR is given, display the file or folder used to cache that specific package\.
.
.TP
\fB\-\-config\fR
Shows Homebrew and system configuration useful for debugging\. If you file a bug report, you will likely be asked for this information if you do not provide it\.
.
.TP
\fB\-S\fR, \fBsearch\fR \fItext\fR|/\fItext\fR/
Performs a substring search of formula names for \fItext\fR\. If \fItext\fR is surrounded with slashes, then it is interpreted as a regular expression\. If no search term is given, all available formula are displayed\.
.
.TP
\fBinstall [\-\-debug] [\-\-use\-llvm] [\-\-ignore\-dependencies] [\-\-HEAD]\fR \fIformula\fR
Installs \fIformula\fR\.
.
.IP
If \fB\-\-debug\fR is passed and brewing fails, opens a shell inside the temporary folder used for compiling\.
.
.IP
If \fB\-\-use\-llvm\fR is passed, attempt to compile using the LLVM front\-end to GCC\. \fINOTE\fR: Not all formulae will build with LLVM\.
.
.IP
If \fB\-\-ignore\-dependencies\fR is passed, skip installing any dependencies of any kind\. If they are not already present, the formula will probably fail to install\.
.
.IP
If \fB\-\-HEAD\fR is passed, and \fIformula\fR defines it, install the HEAD version, aka master, trunk, unstable, dev\.
.
.TP
\fBinstall \-\-interactive [\-\-git]\fR \fIformula\fR
Downloads and patches \fIformula\fR, and then opens a shell\. This allows the user to run \fB\./configure \-\-help\fR and otherwise determine how to turn the software package into a Homebrew formula\.
.
.IP
If \fB\-\-git\fR is passed, Homebrew will create a Git repository, useful for creating patches to the software\.
.
.TP
\fBlist\fR
Lists all installed formulae\.
.
.TP
\fBlist\fR \fIformula\fR
Lists the installed files for \fIformula\fR\.
.
.TP
\fBinfo\fR \fIformula\fR
Gives all available information for \fIformula\fR\.
.
.TP
\fBinfo \-\-github\fR \fIformula\fR
Opens a browser to the GitHub History page for formula \fIformula\fR\.
.
.TP
\fBinfo \-\-all\fR
Summarises all installed packages; this is intended to be used by higher\-level tools\.
.
.TP
\fBinfo\fR \fIURL\fR
Prints the name and version that will be detected for \fIURL\fR; only http:// URLs supported for now\.
.
.TP

Uninstalls \fIformula\fR\.
.
.TP
\fBcreate [\-\-cache]\fR \fIURL\fR
Generates a formula for the downloadable file at \fIURL\fR and opens it in $EDITOR\. Homebrew will attempt to automatically derive the formula name and version, if it fails, you\'ll have to make your own template\. I suggest copying wget\'s\.
.
.IP
If \fB\-\-cache\fR is passed, Homebrew will download the \fIURL\fR to the cache and add the MD5 to the formula for you\.
.
.TP
\fBcreate \-\-macports\fR|\fB\-\-fink\fR \fIformula\fR
Opens a browser to the MacPorts or Fink package search page, so you can see how they do \fIformula\fR\.
.
.TP
\fBedit\fR \fIformula\fR
Opens the formula in $EDITOR\.
.
.TP
\fBedit\fR
Opens all of Homebrew for editing in TextMate\.
.
.TP
\fBlink\fR \fIformula\fR
Symlinks all of \fIformula\fR\'s installed files into the Homebrew prefix\. This is done automatically when you install formula\. It is useful for DIY installation, or in cases where you want to swap out different versions of the same package that you have installed at the same time\.
.
.TP
\fBunlink\fR \fIformula\fR
Unsymlinks \fIformula\fR from the Homebrew prefix\.
.
.TP
\fBprune\fR
Removes dead symlinks from the Homebrew prefix\. This is generally not needed\. However, it can be useful if you are doing DIY installations\.
.
.TP
\fBoutdated\fR
Shows formula that have an updated version available\.
.
.TP
\fBdeps [\-\-1]\fR \fIformula\fR
Shows \fIformula\fR\'s dependencies\.
.
.IP
If \fB\-\-1\fR is passed, only show dependencies one level down, instead of recursing\.
.
.TP
\fBuses [\-\-installed]\fR \fIformula\fR
Shows the formulas that specify \fIformula\fR as a dependency\. The list is not recursive; only one level of dependencies is resolved\.
.
.IP
If \fB\-\-installed\fR is passed, the list only shows formulae you have installed\.
.
.TP
\fBdoctor\fR
Checks your system for potential problems\.
.

.
.SH "EXTERNAL COMMANDS"
Homebrew allows external commands to be defined by putting a +x file named \fBbrew\-<cmdname>\fR or \fBbrew\-<cmdname>\.rb\fR on the PATH\. This will cause Homebrew to recognize \fBbrew cmdname\fR\.
.
.P
Some external commands are shipped with Homebrew, and enabled by default\.
.
.TP
\fBaudit\fR
Checks all formulae for Homebrew coding style violations\. This should be run before submitting a new formula for inclusion\.
.
.TP
\fBfetch\fR \fIformula\fR
Downloads the tarball or checks out from VCS for the given \fIformula\fR\. For tarballs, also prints MD5 and SHA1 checksums\.
.
.TP
\fBman\fR
Regenerates this man page from source\.

.TP
\fBserver\fR
Starts a local webserver with an app that lets you browse available formulae, similar to \fBgem server\fR\.
.
.IP
\fINOTE\fR: Requires \fBsinatra\fR \fIhttp://www\.sinatrarb\.com/\fR\.
.
.TP
\fBtest\fR \fIformula\fR
A few formulae provide a test method\. \fBbrew test <formula>\fR runs this test method\. There is no standard output or return code, but it should generally indicate to the user if something is wrong with the installed formula\.
.
.IP
Example: \fBbrew install jruby && brew test jruby\fR
.
.SH "ENVIRONMENT"
.
.TP
HOMEBREW_DEBUG
If set, instructs Homebrew to always assume \fB\-\-debug\fR when running commands\.
.
.TP
HOMEBREW_DEBUG_INSTALL
When \fBbrew install \-d\fR or \fBbrew install \-i\fR drops into a shell, \fBHOMEBREW_DEBUG_INSTALL\fR will be set to the name of the formula being brewed\.
.
.TP
HOMEBREW_DEBUG_PREFIX
When \fBbrew install \-d\fR or \fBbrew install \-i\fR drops into a shell, \fBHOMEBREW_DEBUG__PREFIX\fR will be set to the target prefix in the Cellar of the formula being brewed\.
.
.TP
HOMEBREW_EDITOR
If set, Homebrew will use this editor when editing a single formula, or several formulae in the same folder\.
.
.IP
\fINOTE\fR: \fBbrew edit\fR will open all of Homebrew as discontinuous files and folders\. TextMate can handle this correctly in project mode, but many editors will do strange things in this case\.
.
.TP
HOMEBREW_KEEP_INFO
If set, Homebrew will not remove files from share/info, allowing them to be linked from the Cellar\.
.
.TP
HOMEBREW_SVN
When exporting from Subversion, Homebrew will use \fBHOMEBREW_SVN\fR if set, a Homebrew\-built Subversion if installed, or the system\-provided binary\.
.
.IP
Set this to force Homebrew to use a particular svn binary\.
.
.TP
HOMEBREW_TEMP
If set, instructs Homebrew to use \fBHOMEBREW_TEMP\fR as the temporary folder for building packages\. This may be needed if your system temp folder and Homebrew Prefix are on different volumes, as OS X has trouble moving symlinks across volumes when the target does not yet exist\.
.
.IP
This issue typically occurs when using FileVault (or certain custom SSD configurations\.)
.
.TP
HOMEBREW_USE_LLVM
If set, instructs Homebrew to use the LLVM front\-ends to the GCC compilers\.
.
.IP
\fINOTE\fR: Not all formulae will build correctly under LLVM\.
.
.TP
HOMEBREW_VERBOSE
If set, instructs Homebrew to always assume \fB\-\-verbose\fR when running commands\.
